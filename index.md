title : CAUASALITY PROJECT
---
## Welcome to the Causality Project

In the Causality Project at HPCC systems, I'll be applying the causality toolkit to real-world dataset to discover, infer, analyze and verify causal relations between variables. With this I will also verify the causal toolkit developed by HPCC Systems.

## About Me

I am **Arun Gaonkar**, pursuing Master's in Computer Science from [North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC](https://www.ncsu.edu/). I have done my *Bachelor of Technology* in *Electronics and Communication Engineering* from [PES University, Bengaluru, KA, INDIA](https://www.pes.edu) in 2020.

I was first exposed to *Artificial Neural Network* by an elective course in my Bachelors. This course elevated my interest in *Machine Learning* which I took in the next semester and enjoyed learning it. Few other courses like *Digital Image Processing*, *Parallel and distributed computing* made heightened my passion for pursuing Master's. During Master's at NCSU, I have improved my skills in Data Science and ML/AI. I am happy to say that I will be applying my learnings in this project. If you are interested in my other Projects please check them out [here](https://github.com/ArunGaonkar?tab=repositories).

During Summer 2022, I will be interning at **HPCC Systems, LexisNexis Risk Solutions**. My office location is Alpharetta, GA, but remote working is also fun. I will be working on the Causality Project under Roger Dev.

I do make spelling mistakes and few intentionally. Please feel to [contact](https://arungaonkar.github.io/ArunGaonkar-HPCC-Causality.github.io/index.html#contact) me if you have any suggestions or if you just wanted to say hi. &#128075;
