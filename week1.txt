following the instructions from the above link, 
* installed ML_core bundle 3.2.2
* installed HPCC_Causality bundle 1.0
* Read the causality toolkit blog https://hpccsystems.com/blog/ml/causality-toolkit
* not able to understand the context of installing in HPCC node.
* successfully installed because 

Meeting notes 1130-1300

more focus on
causal inferences 
causal metrics 

d-separation 
causal models 
back door blocking - due calculations - for casual inferences 
for direct inference - block both forward from parents
so indirect is total -forward 

difference and divide by 2 - average causal effect -- intervening twice

causal notation
causal toolkit
each row

covid19.hpccsystems.com
another dataset
find a proxy for latent variables

Meeting notes 1430-1500

Do not install the HPCC_Platform on windows
Do it again in the Virtual machine - ubuntu 

Got urine test done


05/25 Day 3 Wed

trying to install virtual box and ubuntu 18.04
installation failed twice
installation failed for ubuntu 20.04 
re-installed ubuntu 18.04 and virtual box
looked at Causal blogs and started reading books
looked at covid19 datasets and created analyzed dataset
Installing HPCc failed in VM

05/26 Day 4 Thu

installed HPCC platform image and ran ECL watch, ECL IDLE.
Ran Anagram program
Started ECL training from LexisNexis Risk https://learn.lexisnexis.com/Activity/1035?courseId=HPCC#
Finished first three videos
Had a trouble with installing client tools in windows. and asked roger for help
Instructed to install HPCC Platform using hyper v and not using an image
Installed HPCC platform in Ubuntu in hyperV
followed the instructions sent by by roger in the pdf, originally sent by Lili Xu


Meeting notes 1130-1300

Causal notation:
intervention vs counterfactual
cf - talks about individual events
while intevervtion will be generalist

do calculas - blocking the backdoor path- to make correlation equals to counterfactual

Causal metrics:
1. average CE - two interventions; change in the resulting variable over the change in the causal variable
2. controlled Direct CE - 
3. indirect effect - 

understand the origination of problems
rewriting the expectation calculus
difference between conditional expectation values and through machine learning sampling mechanisms ..!!!


Meeting with Zheyu Shen 1500 -1515
doubt clearing on testing the modules in because

Installed HPCC_Platform in ubuntu in HyperV
Installed HPCC_clienttools, Because module, ML_Core bundle, Causality bundle

Testing the files in because module


05/27 Day 5 Fri

Continued model testing in the because module
Found these bugs & resolved it.

In the line 370 of synth/gen_data.py, change it to "gen.generate(datacount)"

In the file models/M3-discrete.py, line 29 was commented, which was supposed to be uncommented.

And also I have found a syntax error in the models/M5.py, In line 27, there were 2 '='. and 
line 28 and 29 have to be swapped, as D is used before initiation. C is dependent on D.
